## Ada Alum Board

### The Name
In an effort to be gender inclusive, the Ada Alums chose to use the term "alum(s)" (as opposed to "alumni" or "alumnix") for several reasons:  
* "Alum(s)" is universally recognized as gender neutral and sidesteps this issue entirely.
* "Alum(s)" is idiomatic English, already in relatively wide use, and is more likely to be understood than a construction like "alumnix."
* "Alumnix" is sticking an "x" on the traditional masculine form "alumni." Drawing comparisons to "Latinx", it would be like calling "Latinox" gender neutral.
