## Tips to make your Slack experience fun & fruitful
* Join & participate in public channels! There is everything from #interview-questions to #personal-finance to #feelings to #python and many more.
* Job opportunities can be posted in [#jobs](https://theadanetwork.slack.com/messages/jobs/).
* Use the channel that is most appropriate & only cross-post when relevant. An example of when you shouldn't cross post is posting a message of "I'm selling my bike" to both #free-or-selling and #random (it should only be posted in #free-or-selling). An example of when you could cross post might be posting in both #freelancing & #jobs.
* Don't spam channels with links. Share what you found interesting or what your opinion is when you post. Check to see if someone has already posted the article, video, tweet, etc before you. If someone already has shared the thing you wanted to share, start a conversation!
* Don't be afraid to DM! Slack is an excellent way to connect with other Ada alums who you might not already know.

## The #general channel
The #general channel is a group-wide channel to which you will automatically be added upon joining slack. This channel is restricted: since everyone is in this channel and you can't leave the channel, posting is limited to members of the Community Team for the purpose of making announcements and letting members know about community updates. Miscellaneous chit chat should take place in the #random channel.

Announcements for the #general channel may include updates such as changes to the Code of Conduct, this Tips document, or to welcome new Adies that are joining the channel. If you have something you'd like to share with everyone announcement style, please message the community team and we'll help you get the information out in an announcement or guide you to the right channel for posting.

## The #jobs channel
The #jobs channel is a great place to find a new job, post a job listing, or just keep an eye on who is hiring. We encourage you to post jobs that you find that might be relevant to all levels of Adie experience.

To make the #jobs channel as helpful as possible, be sure to include a sentence or two about the job you are posting. If you heard about the job through a friend that you trust, mention that! If someone reached out to you on linkedin but you have no connections to the person or company, post a notice that folks might want to research for themselves. Try to avoid spamming the channel with random job posts that you find online--a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself if the post you are making has more value than a post on a job board. Sometimes it's easy to accidentally send too many posts to the #jobs channel because we all want to be helpful, but as long as you take the time to explain why you are posting this particular job then the benefit to other Adies will be evident!

If you are looking for a job, please post in the #jobs channel! Post a blurb about what you've been up to recently, what kind of job or tech stack you are looking for, as well as any additional information that will help others when keeping an eye out (e.g. "I prefer mid-size startups" or "Looking for remote work" are helpful to include). Be sure to follow up with any leads shared with you and say thanks when appropriate!

Remember that some Adies who are looking for jobs may not feel comfortable with their job hunt being public knowledge or may be worried that their current employer may find out. Please treat any posts in the #jobs or #freelancing channels confidentially unless you are given explicit permission to share that someone is looking for a job.

## Using @here vs @channel & Do Not Disturb
Here’s an overview of the differences:
> “The @here command lets you grab the attention of team members in a channel who are currently active. The @channel command, on the other hand, will send a message to all team members of the channel, whether they are currently signed in and active or not.”
> \- ['Make an announcement' in Slack docs](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement)

The @channel command is for emergencies or major channel-wide announcements that are time sensitive or organizational in nature (example: “@channel there is an armed man in downtown, please stay inside your building”). Please only use @channel for things that everyone needs to know immediately, as @channel sends an push notification to everyone’s phones as well as emails. A good measure is to ask yourself, “If someone is on vacation or in a meeting, do they need to be alerted about this right away?”. If not, then @channel is not appropriate.

For non-urgent announcements that you want to bring to the attention of everyone who is active in the slack channel, @here is best. It will alert those of us who are already online and in the slack, but it won’t interrupt folks who are not online. Keep in mind that folks who are not online when you send the @here notification will see it when they log in and become active! Also, please help fight alert fatigue by only sending one notification per announcement.

We also have default Do Not Disturb setting on this slack. Notifications are automatically disabled from 22:00 to 8:00 (Get a good night’s sleep! 👵). This setting is applied to everyone as they join the slack, but you can change your own Do Not Disturb settings in your profile's settings if you’d like to change the applicable hours or turn it off completely.

Please use your best judgement regarding @here and @channel. We don’t want to interfere with everyone’s ability to do their jobs, live their lives, relax, etc because their Ada slack is blowing up. If you have questions or if you have an announcement that you are unsure of how to handle, feel free to message any member of the Community Team and we can come up with a strategy for disseminating the information.

## Star vs Pin

Star an item in slack that you want to save for your future reference. You can find all your starred items grouped together. No one else can see your collection of starred items.

Pin an item to make a message 'stick' to a channel. Everyone can see the pinned items. They are intended for people to be able to pin messages or files that are relevant to all members of the channel. Try not to pin items that you are just trying to remember for later--if you use a pin, it can create noise for everyone else.

## Archiving & Paid Slack Plans

We are currently on the free Slack plan, which has a limited set of features. There have been recurring conversations over the years about whether or not we should move this workspace to a paid Slack plan. Each time these conversations have come up in the past, we have decided as a community not to move to a paid Slack plan because:
- We hold a philosophy that no member should have to pay to be part of the Ada Network Slack group.
- The paid plans are expensive and priced [per member](https://app.slack.com/plans/T04T5AMQ6). As Ada continues to grow, and our alum community grows, these costs would grow as well.
- We do not qualify for the [non-profit pricing](https://slack.com/help/articles/204368833-Apply-for-the-Slack-for-Nonprofits-discount), which would allow us to have a reduced price per member, but may still be cost-prohibitive.
- We are not willing to sacrifice the autonomy and privacy of the workspace. Specifically, we have decided against approaching Ada or another 3rd party company to sponsor the workspace for this reason.

Any questions related to paying for a Slack plan may be directed back to this document.

_note: Any move to a paid Slack plan will require community buy-in._

### Message Retention

Because we are on a free Slack plan, the admins cannot enforce a message and file [retention policy](https://slack.com/help/articles/203457187-Customize-message-and-file-retention). At the time of writing, Slack's official retention policy for free plans is:

> By default, Slack will retain all messages and files (including audio and video clips) for the lifetime of your workspace.

This means that even though we can only view a limited history of messages and files in our free workspace, if the workspace ever moved to a paid plan or if Slack ever increased the free plan message limit, messages that were previously inaccessible would again become accessible and searchable.

If you would like to manually remove your own messages from Slack, you can do so, but you will not be able to institute a personal retention policy using Slack's retention policy settings. Some options for deleting your messages include manually clicking "Delete message" for each message in the UI, using the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.delete), or leveraging a Chrome extension.
